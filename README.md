# [Your Name]'s Data Analysis Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analysis Portfolio! This repository showcases my experience and skills in data analytics, focusing on creating insightful Tableau dashboards after comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Snowflake. My work typically involves close collaboration with stakeholders, understanding their requirements, and delivering data-driven solutions within agile sprint frameworks.

## Portfolio Overview

In my role as a Data Analyst, I engage in a structured process to deliver meaningful insights to stakeholders. Each project in this portfolio follows a similar workflow:

1. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Understanding requirements and defining project scope.
2. **KPI Identification**: Collaborating to identify and validate key performance indicators.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Using Snowflake to explore and understand data. When data needs to be integrated from various database systems, Alteryx is employed to streamline this process.
4. **SQL Code Development**: Crafting SQL queries and scripts to manipulate and prepare data for analysis. This step is crucial for efficient data handling and analysis.
5. **Visualization**: Creating intuitive and informative Tableau dashboards.
6. **Presentation and Feedback**: Presenting insights to stakeholders and iterating based on feedback.

Each project is completed within a 3-week agile sprint, ensuring timely and efficient delivery of insights.
